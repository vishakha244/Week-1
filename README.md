# 🌳 Tree Species Classification using Machine Learning

## 📅 Week 1 Progress Report

---

### 🌱 About the Project

*Tree species classification* is a crucial application of Artificial Intelligence in the domain of environmental conservation and sustainable ecosystem management. By leveraging data such as leaf characteristics, shape, texture, or images, this project aims to build an intelligent system capable of accurately identifying different tree species.

The goal is to assist botanists, environmentalists, and forest management professionals in automating the process of tree identification, which traditionally relies on manual observation and expert knowledge. Through this project, we explore how *Machine Learning* and *Deep Learning* techniques can support biodiversity protection and promote *green digital solutions*.

This project will involve:

- 📊 Collecting and analyzing relevant datasets (tabular or image-based)
- 🧼 Preprocessing raw data for training models
- 📈 Visualizing patterns and relationships between species and their attributes
- 🤖 Training models like *Decision Trees, **Random Forest, **Support Vector Machines, or **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* for image classification
- 🧪 Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 🧑‍💼 Presenting results and insights in the form of a final report and presentation

By the end of the internship, this project will demonstrate a complete AI pipeline from data to deployment-ready prototype, aligned with *Shell-Edunet-AICTE’s objective* of fostering green skill development through AI.
